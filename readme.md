Addressing common everyday issues and using technology to be an assisting tool in helping life run a bit more smoothly has always been intriguing to me. One common issue I personally encounter is trying to find the best place to leave a quick reminder about something, and how to share them with those who need to see the quick information bits and reminders.

This is where this project founds it origin. What I wanted was a simple, as close to real life solution for posting notes my family could see.

Sticky-Note-Bulletin-Board finds inspiration in real life, it is targeted for larger screens: smartboards, Smart-TVs, or other digital displays. This app could be used as schools, businesses, clubs, public offices, and homes.

Sticky-Note-Bulletin-Board allows user personalization and has the option to share notes to a team-view screen (or family view). Each user can also determine their own layout and background texture by adding a URL in the profile settings, enabling a personal touch. 

Users can create, update, and delete notes, even add pictures, and place the notes anywhere on the board. There are even widgets users can choose to activate and place on their personal views. Currently there is a calendar and a weather widget, other widgets are possible with an easy adaptation of the code.
